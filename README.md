# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction – Capstone Project

## 📘 Overview

This project was developed as part of the TechCrush Data Science Program capstone. Our goal was to apply machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient health indicators such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and chest pain type.
The project demonstrates the full data science workflow — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.


## 🧠 Problem Statement

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can significantly improve prevention and treatment outcomes.
The objective of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on their medical attributes.


## 🧩 Project Phases

Data Cleaning and Exploration – Understanding the dataset and preparing it for modeling.

Feature Preparation and Scaling – Handling features, encoding (where needed), and standardizing data.

Model Building and Evaluation – Training multiple classification models:
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier


Visualization and Insights – Comparing model performances using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best-performing model.


## ⚙️ Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

XGBoost


## 🧾 Results

Among all the models trained, the XGBoost Classifier achieved the highest of all metrics, making it the best-performing model for this dataset.


## 💡 Key Takeaway

This project strengthened our understanding of end-to-end data science workflows — from data preparation to machine learning modeling — and showcased how data-driven insights can be applied to real-world healthcare problems.
